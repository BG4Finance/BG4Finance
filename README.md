- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriele, used to be automation solution developer in the financial industry. Now geek for passion.
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchains, digital assets, structured products, DeFi and lately putting getting my hands dirty with ML and AI... but also, space, avionics, biohacking...
- 🌱 Currently I am developing my own social network powered by AI.
- 💞️ I’m genuinely curious about many thing. I love to drive innovation and my ultimate goal is to make sofisticated finacial products scalable and easier to access for retail investors as for institutional ones.
